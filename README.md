#### Tau <3 YouTube

Tau (é™¶ in Chinese) is a lightweight YouTube application for your Mac. With it you can watch YouTube videos in a new way: you type a keyword, Tau gives you an endless video stream.

Features:

- A clear, modern and native Mac UI instead of an ugly WebKit wrapper
- A native and beautiful stream player just like QuickTime on OS X
- Supports signing in with your YouTube account to synchronize your footprint on YouTube 

Tau is designed to be very easy to use so give it a try! There's a lot room to add new features, so stay tuned.
